# Third-Party Notices

This repository packages upstream `librime` and its build dependencies into
macOS and iOS XCFramework release artifacts.

The wrapper scripts, manifests, and documentation in this repository are
licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License. See `LICENSE`.

Binary release artifacts include upstream `librime` and may include statically
linked third-party dependency code resolved by vcpkg. Keep these notices with
any redistributed binary artifacts.

Release assets include:

- `LICENSE.txt`: the license for this packaging wrapper.
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`: this overview, the upstream `librime` notice, and
  the notices for the Rime plugins merged into librime.
- `third-party-notices.zip`: full license texts for everything the binaries
  statically contain — vcpkg ports under `vcpkg/`, librime's own bundled
  header-only libraries under `librime/`, and the merged Rime plugins under
  `plugins/`.

## Merged Rime plugins

The binary artifacts statically merge the Rime plugins listed below into
librime itself (`BUILD_MERGED_PLUGINS=ON`, `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_PLUGINS=OFF`). The
pinned revisions are recorded in `plugins.json` and in the release
`build-metadata.json`; full license texts are collected into
`third-party-notices.zip` under `plugins/`.

Two further merged plugins, `logsink` and `varpage`, are source directories of
the packaging repository rather than upstream projects. They are covered by this
repository's own BSD 3-Clause license (`LICENSE.txt`), so they have no separate
entries in the notices bundle.

- **librime-lua** — Extending RIME with Lua scripts.
  Upstream project: <https://github.com/hchunhui/librime-lua>
  License: BSD 3-Clause License, Copyright (c) 2021, librime-lua Developers

- **librime-octagram** — RIME grammar plugin (八股文).
  Upstream project: <https://github.com/lotem/librime-octagram>
  License: BSD 3-Clause License, Copyright (c) 2014, RIME Developers
  Note: this plugin was distributed under GPLv3 until it was relicensed to
  BSD 3-Clause in July 2026. Pins older than that relicense must not be used,
  and the build verifies the BSD text is present before merging the plugin.

- **librime-predict** — RIME next-word prediction plugin.

### Bundled header-only libraries

Upstream `librime` compiles in two header-only libraries that are neither
vcpkg ports nor plugins. Their license texts are collected into
`third-party-notices.zip` under `librime/`.

- **darts-clone 0.32** (`include/darts.h`, double-array trie used by the
  dictionary prisms). Upstream: <https://github.com/s-yata/darts-clone>
  License: BSD 3-Clause (and LGPL 2.1 dual offer), Copyright (c) 2008-2013,
  Susumu Yata

- **utf8-cpp** (`include/utf8.h`, `include/utf8/*`, UTF-8 codec used by the
  dictionary and filter code). Upstream: <https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp>
  License: Boost Software License 1.0, Copyright 2006 Nemanja Trifunovic

### Lua runtime

`librime-lua` embeds a Lua interpreter. The artifacts do not use the plugin's
vendored `thirdparty` Lua checkout; the Lua C library is supplied by the vcpkg
`lua` port (Lua 5.5, MIT license, <https://www.lua.org/license.html>) so that
Apple platform patches and version pinning stay with the dependency manifest.
Its license text is collected into `third-party-notices.zip` under `vcpkg/`.
